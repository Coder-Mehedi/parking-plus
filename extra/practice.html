                    <p>Our solution offers pay by space and pay by zone together with efficient and highly reliable enforcement. Within very few years since its establishment. Our brand in Israel, Pango+ has become a dominant force in the mobile payment
                        parking industry in Israel. Connected to almost 50 municipalities and processing over $50 million USD in annual parking fees</p>
                    <p>Following a quick, one-time, registration process the driver can easily activate the parking using his Smartphone (iPhone and Android) with our location based application and with just one-click activation. As an Alternative, MCP provides
                        two solutions for feature phones one is with single line SMS text message that includes the city name and zone. The second alternative is to activate the parking by dialing to an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) with a voice recognition
                        feature which allows the driver to say the name of city and choose the zone</p>

                        Our solution is integrated with Parking Lots and Parking Garages equipped with License Plate Recognition (LPR) which allows quick automatic payment with no need to look for a payment machine or use cash as it is automatically paid from driverâ€™s account.
                        It saves the driver time and generates more revenue for the Parking Lots and Parking Garages owners as the driver pays for the entire time from entering the parking and leaving it. Payment can happen also by scanning the QR code
                        on the ticket for Parking Lots and Parking Garages without an LPR.
