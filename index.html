                    <p>Our solution offers pay by space and pay by zone together with efficient and highly reliable enforcement. Within very few years since its establishment. Our brand in Israel, Pango+ has become a dominant force in the mobile payment
                        parking industry in Israel. Connected to almost 50 municipalities and processing over $50 million USD in annual parking fees</p>
                    <p>
                        Following a quick, one-time, registration process the driver can easily activate the parking using his Smartphone (iPhone and Android) with our location based application and with just one-click activation. As an Alternative, MCP provides two solutions
                        for feature phones one is with single line SMS text message that includes the city name and zone. The second alternative is to activate the parking by dialing to an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) with a voice recognition feature
                        which allows the driver to say the name of city and choose the zone</p>
